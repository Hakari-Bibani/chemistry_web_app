        **What is pH?**
        pH is a measure of the hydrogen ion concentration in a solution. It indicates how acidic or basic a solution is on a scale of 0 to 14.

        **The pH Scale:**
        - pH < 7: Acidic
        - pH = 7: Neutral
        - pH > 7: Basic (Alkaline)

        **Calculating pH:**
        pH = -log[H‚Å∫] where [H‚Å∫] is the concentration of hydrogen ions in mol/L

        **Common Examples:**
        - Lemon juice: pH 2 (acidic)
        - Pure water: pH 7 (neutral)
        - Baking soda: pH 9 (basic)

        **What is pOH?**
        pOH is a measure of the hydroxide ion concentration in a solution. It's a scale similar to pH that indicates how acidic or basic a solution is.

        - pOH < 7: Basic (Alkaline)
        - pOH = 7: Neutral
        - pOH > 7: Acidic

        **Calculating pOH:**
        pOH = -log[OH‚Åª] where [OH‚Åª] is the concentration of hydroxide ions in mol/L

        **Relationship between pH and pOH:**
        In any aqueous solution at 25¬∞C, the following relationship holds: pH + pOH = 14

        Molarity (M) is a measure of the concentration of a solution, expressed as the number of moles of solute per liter of solution.

        **Calculating Molarity:**
        M = moles of solute / liters of solution

        **Important Concepts:**
        1. Standard solutions
