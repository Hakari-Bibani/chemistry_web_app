        Understanding pH:
        - pH is a measure of the hydrogen ion concentration in a solution. It indicates how acidic or basic a solution is on a scale of 0 to 14.
        
        The pH Scale:
        - pH < 7: Acidic
        - pH = 7: Neutral
        - pH > 7: Basic (Alkaline)
        
        Common Examples:
        - Lemon juice: pH 2 (acidic)
        - Pure water: pH 7 (neutral)
        - Baking soda: pH 9 (basic)

        Understanding pOH:
        - pOH is a measure of the hydroxide ion concentration in a solution. It indicates how acidic or basic a solution is.
        
        The pOH Scale:
        - pOH < 7: Basic (Alkaline)
        - pOH = 7: Neutral
        - pOH > 7: Acidic
        
        Relationship between pH and pOH:
        - pH + pOH = 14
