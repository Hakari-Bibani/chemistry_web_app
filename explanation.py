    ### Understanding pH
    **What is pH?**
    pH is a measure of the hydrogen ion concentration in a solution, indicating how acidic or basic it is on a scale of 0 to 14.
    **The pH Scale:**
    - pH < 7: Acidic
    - pH = 7: Neutral
    - pH > 7: Basic (Alkaline)

    **Common Examples:**
    - Lemon juice: pH 2 (acidic)
    - Pure water: pH 7 (neutral)
    - Baking soda: pH 9 (basic)

    **Test Your Knowledge! üìù**

    ### Understanding pOH
    **What is pOH?**
    pOH is a measure of the hydroxide ion concentration in a solution. It's a scale similar to pH that indicates how acidic or basic a solution is.
    
    **The pOH Scale:**
    - pOH < 7: Basic (Alkaline)
    - pOH = 7: Neutral
    - pOH > 7: Acidic

    **Common Examples:**
    - Strong base (like sodium hydroxide): pOH < 7 (basic)
    - Pure water: pOH = 7 (neutral)
    - Strong acid (like hydrochloric acid): pOH > 7 (acidic)

    ### Understanding Molarity
    **What is Molarity?**
    Molarity (M) is a measure of the concentration of a solution, expressed as the number of moles of solute per liter of solution.

    **Applications:**
    - Laboratory solution preparation
    - Chemical analysis
    - Industrial processes
