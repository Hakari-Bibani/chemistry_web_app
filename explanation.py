            **What is pH?**
            pH is a measure of the hydrogen ion concentration in a solution. It indicates how acidic or basic a solution is on a scale of 0 to 14.

            **The pH Scale:**
            - pH < 7: Acidic
            - pH = 7: Neutral
            - pH > 7: Basic (Alkaline)

            **Calculating pH:**
            pH = -log[H‚Å∫] where [H‚Å∫] is the concentration of hydrogen ions in mol/L

            **Common Examples:**
            - Lemon juice: pH 2 (acidic)
            - Pure water: pH 7 (neutral)
            - Baking soda: pH 9 (basic)

        st.subheader("Understanding pOH")
        st.write("""
            **What is pOH?**
            pOH is a measure of the hydroxide ion concentration in a solution. It's a scale similar to pH that indicates how acidic or basic a solution is.

            **The pOH Scale:**
            - pOH < 7: Basic (Alkaline)
            - pOH = 7: Neutral
            - pOH > 7: Acidic

            **Calculating pOH:**
            pOH = -log[OH‚Åª] where [OH‚Åª] is the concentration of hydroxide ions in mol/L

            **Relationship between pH and pOH:**
            In any aqueous solution at 25¬∞C, the following relationship holds:
            pH + pOH = 14

            **Common Examples:**
            - Strong base (like sodium hydroxide): pOH < 7 (basic)
            - Pure water: pOH = 7 (neutral)
            - Strong acid (like hydrochloric acid): pOH > 7 (acidic)

            **What is Molarity?**
            Molarity (M) is a measure of the concentration of a solution, expressed as the number of moles of solute per liter of solution.

            **Calculating Molarity:**
            M = moles of solute / liters of solution

            **Important Concepts:**
            1. Standard solutions
            2. Dilution calculations
            3. Solution preparation

            **Applications:**
            - Laboratory solution preparation
            - Chemical analysis
            - Industrial processes
