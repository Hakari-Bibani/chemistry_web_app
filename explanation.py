        pH is a measure of the hydrogen ion concentration in a solution. It indicates how acidic or basic a solution is on a scale of 0 to 14.
        
        **The pH Scale:**
        - pH < 7: Acidic
        - pH = 7: Neutral
        - pH > 7: Basic (Alkaline)
        
        **Calculating pH:**
        pH = -log[H‚Å∫] where [H‚Å∫] is the concentration of hydrogen ions in mol/L.
        
        **Common Examples:**
        - Lemon juice: pH 2 (acidic)
        - Pure water: pH 7 (neutral)
        - Baking soda: pH 9 (basic)
